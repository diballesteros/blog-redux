You can see a full list of changes right [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases). This fixed a lot of outdated dependencies, gave support to Tailwind, updated Webpack, and a bunch of other changes.\r\n\r\nThis article addresses how I went about the process and all the small little problems I ran into along the way.\r\n\r\n### Updating\r\n\r\nIn order to update the version from 4 to 5 run the following command:\r\n\r\n![Yarn command to update react-scripts](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641140790654/FALCjxcAZ.png)\r\n\r\nUpon starting up the dev environment for my app I noticed that the compile-time reduced considerably, which was a welcome change! But I also received several warnings and errors after updating and starting up the app.\r\n\r\n### Warning\r\n\r\nMy first warning was about the source maps for third party libraries that don’t actually exist:\r\n\r\nFailed to parse source map from ...\\node_modules\\html-to-image\\src\\applyStyleWithOptions.ts' file: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory\r\n\r\nFor the time being, I’m not aware of a way to avoid this with a setting so to omit the warnings in the terminal I decided to no longer output the source maps, specifically for the dev environment.\r\n\r\nIn the root folder I created the following file: .env.development and added the following line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGENERATE_SOURCEMAP=FALSE\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe development suffix is important because I needed the source maps in production because of some third-party libraries.\r\n\r\n### Errors\r\n\r\nI received two major errors after the update, the first one was related to CSS-In-Modules in combination with SASS:\r\n\r\nInvalid dependencies have been reported by plugins or loaders for this module. All reported dependencies need to be absolute paths.  \r\nInvalid dependencies may lead to broken watching and caching.\r\n\r\nLuckily enough in the error message itself the file that was being affected was referenced, for example:\r\n\r\n![Sass error](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641140792165/iXeMKptnj.png)\r\n\r\nThis one was fairly simple to solve as the error message itself indicated the solution, just have to change the relative path to an absolute path. So this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@use 'styles/mixins';\r\n@import 'styles/variables';\r\n```\r\n\r\nchanged to this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@use 'src/styles/mixins';\r\n@import 'src/styles/variables';\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy final error was:\r\n\r\nERROR in Failed to load config \"react\" to extend from.  \r\nReferenced from: \\*/.eslintrc.json\r\n\r\nThis error is in reference to ESLint, from what I could gather their internal ESLint was running into a conflict with my personal configurations, to circumvent this I changed up the dependencies in the .eslintrc.json file.\r\n\r\nI use a variety of extensions but I left it as follows, removing “react” and adding in “react-app”\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"extends\": [\r\n\"react-app\",\r\n...Other dependencies\r\n]\r\n```\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,43,49],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
