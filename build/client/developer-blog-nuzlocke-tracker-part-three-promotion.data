Truth be told I’m a complete novice when it comes to promoting an app, however, I decided to dive headfirst.\r\n\r\n### Where to?\r\n\r\nI knew that I would have to begin to research SEO. Unfortunately from my research, I found out that React apps are typically at a disadvantage when it comes to SEO. This is because the crawlers that index the page look through the HTML however the HTML of a React app is dynamically generated.\r\n\r\nThere are several solutions to this such as SSG-type frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby. I decided to deploy with Netlify because they offer a plugin precisely to generate a SPA (such as React) to further help with crawlers. This would help initially with it appearing in searches.\r\n\r\nAlso, I figured I would show this to various Nuzlocke communities. I focused my efforts on Reddit as there is a fairly active community around Nuzlocking.\r\n\r\nThis is the original post. It was very successful! Not only was it very well received, but I also received a ton of feedback to make the app considerably better.\r\n\r\nI also posted it to other Nuzlocke forums and various discord communities!\r\n\r\n### The follow-up\r\n\r\nAs I continued to iterate over the app I posted it several times over the course of the past couple of months to show and detail the updates.\r\n\r\nEvery thread was fairly well-received but none of them were as successful as the first, however, every single time I gained critical insight into bugs and features people would appreciate.\r\n\r\n### SEO\r\n\r\nAs for how the SEO went after all the posts, it was a mixed bag. For Google, it’s been a real struggle to get to the top page, although a majority of the links ahead of me seem to be illegitimate backlinks.\r\n\r\nHowever, on bing and several other search engines, I am consistently within the top ten. Researching on how to exactly boost up the position on a google search definitely requires more research.\r\n\r\nThat’s it for now! I will most likely make another more detailed post on how to boost SEO from all the research I did on React apps.\r\n","recommendations",[29,36,44,50],{"_7":30,"_9":31,"_11":12,"_13":32,"_15":33,"_19":34,"_21":22,"_23":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
