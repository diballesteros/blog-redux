This is a very extremely useful feature! However, it can be a little cumbersome to specifically reach different custom _nested_ types from the requests without it being too verbose.\r\n\r\nBut, being a little creative with some native Typescript functions we can find a way to handle this exact use case!\r\n\r\n### The example\r\n\r\n![Generated Type](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468721047/mt0yAqeqC.png)\r\n\r\nLet’s take for example this generated type (this will be a fairly simple type with a nested subtype):\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to extract the type of the array without it getting too verbose we could use some conditional typing from Typescript.\r\n\r\n### Extraction Type\r\n\r\n![Extraction Type](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468723206/SRFcrsz14.png)\r\n\r\nThe following type allows us to extract it:\r\n\r\nIt can be a little confusing at first glance but let’s break down every portion. First, we have our ArrayElement which is a [generic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) receiving the array itself as T.\r\n\r\nHere the infer keyword from typescript (which must be used with extends) to declaratively introduce a new generic type U based on the given array.\r\n\r\nNow let’s assume that the TStuff type is an array and we want to extract a singular TStuff. We could then supply the type of TStuff to ArrayElement\\<T\\>\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntype TNestedStuff = ArrayElement<TStuff[]>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The result\r\n\r\nLooking at the result of the extracted type we can now use it however we wish or even assign it as its own type to make it less verbose!\r\n\r\n![Result Extracted Type](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468724658/VhKWGR_ie.png)\r\n\r\nHere is the code sandbox to play around with the type and the Typescript documentation :\r\n\r\n[Documentation - Conditional Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html#inferring-within-conditional-types)\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,45,51],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
