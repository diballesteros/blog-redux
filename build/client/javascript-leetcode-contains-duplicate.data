I am not haphazardly selecting any questions. I am following along with this list for those that were curious:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions\r\n\r\n### Prompt\r\n\r\n> Given an integer array `nums` , return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.\r\n\r\n**Example 1:**\r\n\r\n```text\r\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,1]\r\nOutput: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the problem seems to be pretty simple. The idea here is to iterate over the array and find any duplicates. There's a bit of a cheat code we can use with JavaScript in this one.\r\n\r\n### First Solution (cheating)\r\n\r\nThere is a standard built-in object for JavaScript called [Set] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)\r\n\r\nBut what does this object do?\r\n\r\n> `Set` objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the `Set`'s collection.\r\n\r\nKnowing this, the only thing we need to do is convert our array into a `Set` and compare its length with the original `number` array length.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar containsDuplicate = function (nums) {\r\n\tconst set = new Set([...nums]);\r\n\treturn set.size != nums.length;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nConverting an array into a `Set` is simple, just spread it in a new array in the `Set` constructor. It has a property to calculate the size (number of items). We just have to compare that with the length of the original array, `nums`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn set.size != nums.length;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Second Solution\r\n\r\nMuch like our (first solution)[https://relatablecode.com/javascript-leetcode-two-sum] we can create a hash table of our array as we're iterating and evaluate it in place.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar containsDuplicate = function (nums) {\r\n\tconst hashTable = new Map();\r\n\r\n\tfor (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\r\n\t\tif (hashTable.has(nums[i])) return true;\r\n\t\telse hashTable.set(nums[i], true);\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn false;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo break this down a little bit: we first iterate over the array of numbers. If the `map` already has the value then we return `true`. We check this with the `.has` property of `map`s\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif(hashtable.has(nums[i]) return true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we add it to the `map` and move on.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nelse hashTable.set(nums[i], true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value is pretty irrelevant as we don't really care much for it. There probably is a data structure more suited here.\r\n\r\n### Let's connect\r\n\r\nMore content at [Relatable Code](https://relatablecode.com)\r\n\r\nIf you liked this feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/relatablecode) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/relatablecoder)\r\n\r\nCheck out my free developer roadmap and weekly tech industry news in my [newsletter](https://relatablecode.substack.com/).\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,44,50],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
