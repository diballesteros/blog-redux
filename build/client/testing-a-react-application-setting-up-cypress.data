This time I'll go over how to initially configure [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), our End-to-End testing framework.\r\n\r\nCheck out the other parts here:\r\n\r\n[First part](https://relatablecode.com/testing-a-react-application-the-modern-approach)\r\n\r\n[Second part](https://relatablecode.com/testing-a-react-application-the-setup)\r\n\r\n[Third part](https://relatablecode.com/testing-a-react-application-what-is-vitest)\r\n\r\n[Fourth part](https://relatablecode.com/testing-a-react-application-creating-a-unit-test)\r\n\r\n[Fifth part](https://relatablecode.com/testing-a-react-application-integrating-msw-with-vitest)\r\n\r\nIn the previous parts of this series, I went over how to set up our [unit-testing framework with Vitest](https://relatablecode.com/testing-a-react-application-integrating-msw-with-vitest). Unit tests will cover more isolated and individual pieces of code like our functions or component-only tests if necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Cypress and its test will handle the other big chunk where we can really gain confidence that our tests will behave similarly to how a user would use the application. Just to catch up let's go over what our simple barebones app does.\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on a button it fetches posts from a service and displays them on the page:\r\n\r\n![Testing a react application](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1653220814601/IXI3Twik-.png align=\"left\")\r\n\r\n### What is Cypress?\r\n\r\nThe first phrase you'll see when navigating to their page is the following:\r\n\r\n> Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.\r\n\r\nThe keyword for this quote is **browser**. Cypress' test runner replicates the browser environment. That means whatever test we create will behave exactly as if running in the browser. This gives us a ton of confidence!\r\n\r\nOn top of that, with Cypress we can test with several different browser environments: Google Chrome and Firefox being among them. Cypress comes with its own syntax at times but if you're familiar with Vitest or Jest then it should come naturally. The docs are actively maintained and well structured.\r\n\r\n[Take a look at them](https://docs.cypress.io/)\r\n\r\n![thumbs up relatablecode](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1653223455475/J4CgrxFOP.png align=\"left\")\r\n_Photo by Sincerely Media on Unsplash_\r\n\r\nEnough talking, let's start setting up Cypress.\r\n\r\n### Configuration Files for Cypress\r\n\r\nFirst, we have to install the necessary dependencies:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install cypress --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn add cypress --dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nMuch like other libraries, this will have a configuration file at the root of our project: `cypress.json`. Let's go ahead and create it. Within this file, you can set a variety of different flags. Check out this [article](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Global) in the docs to better understand all the options.\r\n\r\nWhen first launching any Cypress test we have to manually visit the pages we want to test. So instead of writing out the entire URL every single time we'll go ahead and include the `baseUrl` in this config.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"baseUrl\": \"http://localhost:3000\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that, the only other configuration we need to set up is the scripts in our `package.json`.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    // ...other scripts,\r\n    \"e2e\": \"cypress open\",\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck out the full repository up to this point [here](https://github.com/diballesteros/react-testing).\r\n\r\nNext time we'll create our first test with Cypress as well as make sure our integration with MSW holds up.\r\n\r\n### Let's connect\r\n\r\nIf you liked this feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/relatablecode) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/relatablecoder)\r\n\r\nCheck out my free developer roadmap and weekly tech industry news in my [newsletter](https://relatablecode.substack.com/).\r\n","recommendations",[29,37,42,48],{"_7":30,"_9":31,"_11":12,"_13":32,"_15":33,"_19":35,"_21":22,"_23":36},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
