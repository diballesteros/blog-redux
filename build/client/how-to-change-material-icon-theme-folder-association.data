It’s very visually appealing and helps me quickly mentally locate whatever I need inside the explorer.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all folder names and types are covered by default. But, they do offer a way to add your own associations with custom icons as well pre-existing icons.\r\n\r\nChanging the icon\r\nIn this example, I’ll be changing the icon for a folder named cypress. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is used for end-to-end testing so I figured I should change the default Icon to something more oriented for testing.\r\n\r\nFirst, let’s go ahead and open up Visual Studio Code and hit `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `p`\r\n\r\nThis should open up possible commands. Type in User Settings.\r\n\r\n![Visual Studio Code User Settings](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649284606138/cfwZqUEmT.png)\r\n\r\nUpon opening them up, we can see the search bar, search for folder icon.\r\n\r\nIn Material-icon-theme > Folders: Associations click on “Edit in settings.json”\r\n\r\nThere should be a section called material-icon-theme.folders.associations\r\n\r\nInside we can start changing the folder associations\r\n\r\n![Material Icon Theme settings.json](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649284607345/pUIDovuTs2.png)\r\n\r\nI updated it to include cypress with the test folder association.\r\n\r\nFor default images this can be used as a reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/PKief/vscode-material-icon-theme/main/images/folderIcons.png\r\n\r\nNow cypress will show up with the updated icon:\r\n\r\n![New cypress icon](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649284608477/uEhtI5S_q.png)\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,45,51],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
