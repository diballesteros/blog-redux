But after some conversations, I figured I’d add another entry explaining the thought process for working through the README file.\r\n\r\nA good readme can give a base explanation of the intention and proposed solution of the project as well as give a quick guide on how to start contributing to the application (if it’s open-source)\r\n\r\nHere’s the [README](https://github.com/diballesteros/nuzlocke/blob/master/README.md) to check it out while reading through this short blog post.\r\n\r\n### Status checks\r\n\r\nAt the very top of my README, I opted into leaving some quick status badges for several of the third-party libraries I have associated with my app: [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/), [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), [codeql](https://codeql.github.com/), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and several Github status points!\r\n\r\n![image](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641742152339/R96eKU9N5.png)\r\n\r\nI feel like this gives a pretty sweet overview of the health of the app!\r\n\r\n### About\r\n\r\nI split this section up into two sections. A quick list of the main features of the app and a ‘How it works’ section with gifs and screenshots! I feel like these screenshots give a much more tangible view of how the application works. These can be hooked up pretty easily using [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) and [giphy](https://giphy.com/).\r\n\r\nI upload the necessary gifs and images and simply link them through the markdown:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n<!-- Example Gif -->\r\n\r\n![til](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641742153586/vqNTttGTF.gif)\r\n\r\n<!-- Example Image -->\r\n\r\n![Imgur Image](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641742155213/ksJzopDyo.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![example images](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641742156869/XZsApWxMK.png)\r\n\r\n### Quickstarts\r\n\r\nAfterward, I include several sections that help other contributors get quickly started with the app with the following sections:\r\n\r\n-   Prerequisites —I quickly lay out the CLI commands to get started\r\n-   Running the tests — Commands needed to double-check over the code and make sure everything is still A-okay\r\n-   Roadmap — Just a small section linking to the issues page for the Github repository to know which issues can be worked on\r\n-   Deployment — Brief summary on how the project is deployed to netlify\r\n-   Versioning — Explanation of how versioning works. In this case, SemVer is used as it seems to be the industry standard\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nThis is probably one of the more important sections of the entire README where you can reference, at least in my case, a CONTRIBUTING.md for a more in-depth explanation of how to contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nGithub can help out with a generic format but I suggest making adjustments respective to your project.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this section should reference the CODE_OF_CONDUCT and any special steps needed for the pull request process.\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nAt the very end, I added a small section to be able to contact me as well as some legal information as the app is pokemon related in nature.\r\n","recommendations",[29,36,43,49],{"_7":30,"_9":31,"_11":12,"_13":32,"_15":33,"_19":34,"_21":22,"_23":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
