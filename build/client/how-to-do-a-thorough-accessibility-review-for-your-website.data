Fear not there are some guidelines you can follow!\r\n\r\nFor a lot of users that depend on well-done accessibility, keyboard navigation is the go-to method to using a website. The good news is though, that this can be tested quite easily. Let’s start by hitting the tab key and checking how it navigates through the content.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div tabindex=\"0\">First Tabbable Element</div>\r\n<div tabindex=\"0\">Second Tabbable Element</div>\r\n<div tabindex=\"0\">Third Tabbable Element</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe elements that are highlighted are considered **focused** , [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/focus) you can find a quick write-up on some fundamentals on what should be focused or not.\r\n\r\nSome things to note, you should typically avoid any **tabindex** number over 0. This can be very confusing and cause tabbing inconsistencies. Stick to 0! Controls that can be interacted with should definitely be focusable with a **tabindex** and elements that aren’t focusable should not be focusable to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nAlso another side note! Make sure when tabbing nothing ends up offscreen and lost forever! Just tab through the entire website and make sure everything that needs to be interacted with, can be properly interacted with.\r\n\r\n### Screen Reader\r\n\r\nGoing through the process of using a screen-reader and how it interacts with your website is the next step to making sure everything is accessible. Using one is quite easy!\r\n\r\nNVDA is a popular open-source screen reader that is free to use! Here is the download [link](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/). Don’t be alarmed once you hear the text-to-speech upon installing. MAC Users might want to look into VoiceOver.\r\n\r\nWhen highlighting the cursor over any element or typing the screen reader should activate and audibly interpret what’s on-screen. For developers this is critical and the way we typically interact with the screen reader is the aria properties!\r\n\r\nFor example, if we happen to have a button that has only an icon and no text this is a perfect situation for **aria labels**!\r\n\r\nThis is also very important with images and here is a situation where the **alt** property shines.\r\n\r\nMoving the cursor over the image will read out the alt text.\r\n\r\nAny content that you want to hide from the screen reader should have the aria-hidden property.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\">I'm invisible</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Semantic Structure\r\n\r\nAnother core principle of a website being accessible is having the correct semantic structure. In this case, it means using the **h1 ** —  **h6** tags in proper order and where it’s relevant. Correctly structuring the page within main, header, footer, and nav tags.\r\n\r\nIf you want more information on Semantic HTML check out [my article](https://relatablecode.com/semantic-html-explained-and-how-to-use-it/) for a more in-depth explanation.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s it! As a final tip if you open up the developer tools and header over to the Lighthouse tab you can generate a report for accessibility! This is continually getting improved so it’s worth checking out when working on your site.\r\n\r\n![Lighthouse Dev Tools](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1645617644094/CmGrt2mmJ.png)\r\n\r\nSide note: check out Google’s [guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/how-to-review?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr) on accessibility for more details.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-ballesteros-9468a7136/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/relatablecoder)\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,44,50],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
