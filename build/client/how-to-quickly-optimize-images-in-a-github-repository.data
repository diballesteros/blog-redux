Taking into consideration the size of said images can be incredibly important to lower the size of the entire page/web app.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of services online that can be used to optimize images but Github directly has access to a method of optimization!\r\n\r\nIn this short tutorial, I’ll quickly go over how to set it up in your repo, this entire process should take under 5 minutes!\r\n\r\n### Marketplace\r\n\r\n![ImgBot](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640538017877/wNlvyPJwh.png)\r\n\r\nWithin the Github marketplace, which can be accessed from the top bar of Github, you can access a variety of different tools for your repository! One of which is the [ImgBot](https://github.com/marketplace/imgbot).\r\n\r\nAs per the published: true\r\ndescription: “Imgbot is a friendly robot that optimizes your images and saves you time. Optimized images mean smaller file sizes without sacrificing quality.”\r\n\r\nGreat! Once you’re on the page you can set up the plan. As a disclaimer, ImgBot does have paid plans for private repos but for public repos it is completely free!\r\n\r\nAfter selecting the plan you can complete the installation, as an aside you can also select which repositories you specifically want to install it to.\r\n\r\n### Pull request\r\n\r\n![ImgBot Detail](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640538019531/tkoQ1d7Ku.png)\r\n\r\nAfter installing the ImgBot it will automatically create a pull request after analyzing all the images.\r\n\r\nIt’ll even tell you exactly how much the images were reduced by:\r\n\r\nAnd within detail it’ll give a breakdown of every single image that was altered:\r\n\r\n![Picture details](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640538021221/hEzOkcVU4.png)\r\n\r\nThe way the ImgBot optimizes every file can be different but to give an example here are two files:\r\n\r\nFor a PNG file it reduces the size:\r\n\r\n![PNG files](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640538022622/d0oocn1aE.png)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for an SVG it takes away all the empty space and essentially minifies it:\r\n\r\n![SVG file](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640538024300/zDyzDDSPZ.png)\r\n\r\nAfterward, it’s just reviewing all the changes and accepting the PR merge into the main branch, as easy as that!\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,45,51],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
