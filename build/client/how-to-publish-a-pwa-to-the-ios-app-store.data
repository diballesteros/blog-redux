I previously used it to create the files necessary to publish my app to the Google Playstore and the Windows Store. Recently an option was added for the App Store as well!\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: I’m only aware of being able to do this on a MAC OS as it is required to use XCODE to bundle and ship off the software to App Store Connect.\r\n\r\nIf there is a method with Windows mention it in the comments!\r\n\r\n### PWABuilder\r\n\r\n![ship pwa](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468711373/KqFps4yX4.png)\r\n\r\nPWABuilder URL Input\r\n\r\nFirstly, let’s navigate to PWABuilder.com and enter the corresponding URL in the input above. Afterward, some basic stats are provided. By hitting the next button we can now start generating the files.\r\n\r\n![ios options](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468713221/ytiyhlw8B.png)\r\n\r\nPWABuilder iOS Option\r\n\r\nNext, hit the store package option for iOS.\r\n\r\nIn the generated folder the team at PWABuilder included a next-step guide to work through the process of generating package:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-ios/blob/main/next-steps.md](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-ios/blob/main/next-steps.md)\r\n\r\nFollow through the steps and you’ll be able to begin the publishing process! Do note that to be able to publish an app in the App Store a developer license must be purchased.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of my own personal app being published:\r\n\r\n![nuzlocke tracker ios listing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468714452/CidOjxmMh.png)\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,45,51],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
