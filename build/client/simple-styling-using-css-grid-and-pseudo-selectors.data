Although this article won’t go into full detail on how it’s being implemented one thing that I had to do was set up the layout (obviously).\r\n\r\nI decided that the best course of action for this was to use a [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) to lay everything out. One of the requirements is that it was necessary to have column groups with different color backgrounds. Simple enough right?\r\n\r\n### Planning it out\r\n\r\nWhere possible I like to use CSS and not javascript as it tends to be considerably faster. In this case, instead of iterating over the array and manually applying the styling that way, I decided the best way would be to use a CSS pseudo-selector in order to determine which columns should be colored.\r\n\r\nLuckily enough there exists a [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) called nth-of-child and nth-of-type. These can be used to dynamically apply a set of CSS styling to a specific number of children. How you may ask? Well the selector can be used in conjunction with simple math to plan it out\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nli:nth-child(2) {\r\n\tcolor: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Determining the sequence\r\n\r\nWithin the selector we have the option to select a child with the following operation: an + b So for example, if we were to just list out nth-child(3) it would be the third child. With the following sequence nth-child(2n) it would be every second child starting with the second.\r\n\r\nIn my particular case, I had to group up the columns by 4 and style them that way.\r\n\r\nWhat I ended up going with was the following sequence:\r\n\r\n![code](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468733642/_M_x5X1pw.png)\r\n\r\nColumn styling\r\n\r\nWith this, we are grouping up the columns by 8 and only coloring the second group of columns as by subtracting I am targeting the final four each time.\r\n\r\nHere is the provided example:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/embed/jolly-nobel-27rtv?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,45,51],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
