The introduction of Bun is just further proof of that and boy is it powerful.\r\n\r\nBut, what is Bun?\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666528991766/57JJho83P.png)\r\n\r\n> Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime\r\n\r\nSource: [https://bun.sh/](https://bun.sh/)\r\n\r\nWhat makes it \"all-in-one\" though? Well, let's just head one line down for their personal description of what makes it stand out amongst the competition.\r\n\r\n> Bundle, transpile, install and run JavaScript & TypeScript projects — all in Bun. Bun is a new JavaScript runtime with a native bundler, transpiler, task runner and npm client built-in.\r\n\r\nThat is a ton of functionality baked (heh) into one runtime. One of the things that caught my eye was that it also automatically transpiles files. That means you can just use Typescript and JSX with **no setup** needed.\r\n\r\nThat sort of functionality truly does feel like it should be the norm. These tools are tried-and-tested and them **just** working feels right.\r\n\r\nHowever, I tend to use my Windows computer a lot because I tend to game on the side. For convenience's sake, I also do a lot of coding on my Windows computer (where applicable). So I decided to give Bun a shot whilst on my Windows computer.\r\n\r\nLet's dive right in on how to set it up.\r\n\r\n### Setting up WSL\r\n\r\nIn order for us to install certain functionalities we need to set up a Linux distribution on our Windows machine. Thankfully, the developers at Microsoft have created something called the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\r\n\r\n> The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.\r\n\r\nIf you want more info [check out the full docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what we're looking for to set up Bun.\r\n\r\nOpen up the Windows Powershell (with admin privileges) and run the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nwsl --install\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll probably get a line of messages similar to this:\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666529251767/yxuXvdSO-.png)\r\n\r\nAwesome! Let's restart our machine.\r\n\r\nAfter restarting the terminal will automatically attempt to run some commands. However, you may get the following error:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nInstalling, this may take a few minutes...\r\nWslRegisterDistribution failed with error 0x80370102\r\nError: 0x80370102 The virtual machine could not be started because a required feature is not installed\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, virtualization may not be enabled on your PC. How to enable this can vary from processor to processor so I just did a quick google search. In my case, I had an AMD Ryzen, so I had to reboot and enable SVM in my BIOS settings.\r\n\r\nAfter enabling open up another terminal and run the following command to re-install the Linux distribution. If it previously worked you can skip this step.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nwsl --install -b Ubuntu\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install and ask you to create a UNIX user account.\r\n\r\n#### Installing Docker Desktop\r\n\r\nIt's **recommended** to use Docker Desktop with WSL. Let's go ahead and get that set up.\r\n\r\n[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)\r\n\r\nDownload the executable and install Docker Desktop.\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666537232942/yODLSyKdC.png)\r\n\r\nThis will require a logout. Afterward, head into settings and make sure `Use the WSL 2-based engine` is enabled.\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666537822168/LLjRvz5Ov.png)\r\n\r\nIn `Resources`, under WSL Integration make sure your installed distro is enabled as well.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed instructions and troubleshooting [check out the WSL docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers).\r\n\r\n### Using Bun on Windows\r\n\r\nThat was quite a bit of prep just to use Bun. Grab a coffee and come back so we can continue!\r\n\r\n#### Installing Bun\r\n\r\nOpen up the Ubuntu (just search up Ubuntu from the Start menu and it should appear if it was installed correctly) instance and install unzip.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt install unzip\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd install bun\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl https://bun.sh/install | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666538608382/uxdPeHVAT.png)\r\n\r\nOne more step. We have to add a few lines manually to our `.bashrc`\r\n\r\nNow you have full access to the bun commands! Restart the Ubuntu terminal and run\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbun --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should confirm if it was correctly installed or not.\r\n\r\n#### Testing out Bun\r\n\r\nI'll be using Vscode to simplify the process but it's not necessary. Vscode has an extension available to integrate it with WSL easily.\r\n\r\nHere are their docs for more info:\r\n\r\n[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)\r\n\r\nUnder extensions just look up WSL to install the respective extension\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666540288916/mf1tpFlq3.png)\r\n\r\nAwesome!\r\n\r\nTo test this out create a folder with the name `http.js` and add the following lines to the file (note this is straight from the docs):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n\tport: 3000,\r\n\tfetch(request) {\r\n\t\treturn new Response('Welcome to Bun!');\r\n\t},\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen the folder with vscode. In the bottom left of the vscode screen you should see a button with two arrows\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666540407335/uMXkfB4y4.png)\r\n\r\nClick it and select the option to re-open the folder with WSL. Your terminal should now be connected to the Ubuntu instance. From here run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbun run http.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt http://localhost:3000 you'll now see the executed file!\r\n\r\n![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666540630301/quJYgVYTm.png)\r\n\r\n### Wrapping it up\r\n\r\nThat was quite the setup but now we can do more complex things with Bun. In the next article, I'll go over how to set up a more complex project.\r\n\r\nDo note that Bun is still in Beta so you may encounter some issues! They have an active discord so I recommend checking them out if you run into any problems.\r\n\r\n### Let's Connect\r\n\r\nIf you liked this feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/relatablecode) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/relatablecoder)\r\n\r\nCheck out my free developer roadmap and weekly tech industry news in my [newsletter](https://relatablecode.substack.com/).\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,44,49],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
