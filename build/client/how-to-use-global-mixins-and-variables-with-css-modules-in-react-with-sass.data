Typically I tend to prefer more traditional CSS with separated files.\r\n\r\nOutside of the arguments of why this may be preferred or not it’s still fairly useful to have a set of global mixins (SASS) and/or variables to keep it DRY.\r\n\r\nStarting an app with Create-React-App or next a fairly common option is to use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) which guarantees that the styles per component will not have any conflicts, however, it does mean it’s slightly different to access these global variables.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial assumes you already have a react app ready to configure.\r\n\r\n### The package\r\n\r\nCreate-react-app docs recommend using [node-sass](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/) for the styling, however, this is deprecated so I would suggest using sass (Dart Sass) as it is still actively receiving support. This can be quickly done with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn add sass\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install sass\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The stylesheet\r\n\r\nNow with that out of the way let’s create a file for our mixins with the name \\_variables.scss:\r\n\r\n![variables](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468742684/ji2YxUech.png)\r\n\r\nMixin stylesheet\r\n\r\nIn the actual style sheet, it can be imported in the following way (any file \\*.module.scss):\r\n\r\n![stylesheet](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468744199/STkI5E8_Z.png)\r\n\r\nImported mixins\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\nFor variables it would be something very similar, let’s have a file with the name \\_variables.scss:\r\n\r\n![variables](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468745880/iWf-EKaMW.png)\r\n\r\nVariable stylesheet\r\n\r\nAnd importing it can be done in a similar fashion:\r\n\r\n![stylesheet](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468747330/TpLGR84DDB.png)\r\n\r\nThis can be quite useful to reuse a lot of variables and similar styles throughout the entire project while still maintaining the module structure.\r\n\r\nFor example, I did something along these lines to share variables to use in media queries throughout my project:\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468749050/V1lBq37MB.png)\r\n\r\nExample stylesheet\r\n\r\nThis is quite useful as I used a combination of CSS variables and SASS variables to reuse a lot of fixed sizes and paddings to keep everything standardized throughout the entire app.\r\n","recommendations",[29,37,45,51],{"_7":30,"_9":31,"_11":12,"_13":32,"_15":33,"_19":35,"_21":22,"_23":36},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
