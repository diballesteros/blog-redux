For the sake of this example, the manipulation isn’t too complex and you could probably just extend the original type. More information on extending [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html#extending-interfaces).\r\n\r\nHowever, if we were to assume we don’t have the original typing declared or the manipulation is considerably more complex it would be simpler just to extract the type from the result of the function.\r\n\r\n### Extraction Type\r\n\r\nThe following utility type from Typescript lets us directly extract the type!\r\n\r\n![Return type](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639313431911/pi_V9ImCU.png)\r\n\r\nNow we can set an alias or just directly use the type around our application to feel a little safer when we’re manipulating the data. This is awesome!\r\n\r\nNow if we go through the entire series of steps:\r\n\r\n![Full example](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1639313433346/ZxQwiHvZI.png)\r\n\r\nNo errors when sending in myself to the transformation function and now we can use the type anywhere else in the application!\r\n\r\nHere’s a little sandbox to play around with the typing:\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,45,51],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
