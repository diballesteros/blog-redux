However, this can easily be done with some basic HTML and CSS whilst adding some react-y props.\r\n\r\nThe basic usage can be implemented with a simple HTML Input. Something that is not readily apparent is that an input can be of various types. One of these is of type range.\r\n\r\nThis is how it normally looks:\r\n\r\n![input](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468773024/QCAn5-eD9.png)\r\n\r\nHTML Input type range\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input type=\"range\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, while this may fulfill the slider component necessity there are a few things that limit it. We should add some styling and make it so the values of the min and max.\r\n\r\n### Styling\r\n\r\nLet’s dig into the CSS\r\n\r\n```css\r\ninput[type='range'] {\r\n\t-webkit-appearance: none;\r\n\theight: 7px;\r\n\tbackground: grey;\r\n\tborder-radius: 5px;\r\n\tbackground-image: linear-gradient(#d46a6a, #d46a6a);\r\n\tbackground-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n![input](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468774398/9vtA9QPJE.png)\r\n\r\nBar Styled\r\n\r\nThis first bit of styling is to target the bar targeting the color and shape:\r\n\r\nHowever it still looks a bit awkward with the circle being of a different color, we can target this portion with a selector: -webkit-slider-thumb\r\n\r\n```css\r\ninput[type='range']::-webkit-slider-thumb {\r\n\t-webkit-appearance: none;\r\n\theight: 20px;\r\n\twidth: 20px;\r\n\tborder-radius: 50%;\r\n\tbackground: #d46a6a;\r\n\tcursor: pointer;\r\n\tbox-shadow: 0 0 2px 0 #555;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n![input](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468775846/O2MZ5MpYr.png)\r\n\r\nThumb Styled\r\n\r\nSimple enough we just make the circle a bit bigger and change the color to match the rest of the component.\r\n\r\nHowever its not very clear what part of the bar is being filled, so let’s change that by changing the track of the slider:\r\n\r\n```css\r\ninput[type='range']::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {\r\n\t-webkit-appearance: none;\r\n\tbox-shadow: none;\r\n\tborder: none;\r\n\tbackground: transparent;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, we also need a way to calculator the current background size of the bar:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [value, setValue] = useState(0);\r\nconst MAX = 10;\r\nconst getBackgroundSize = () => {\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\tbackgroundSize: `${(value * 100) / MAX}% 100%`,\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<input\r\n\ttype=\"range\"\r\n\tmin=\"0\"\r\n\tmax={MAX}\r\n\tonChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}\r\n\tstyle={getBackgroundSize()}\r\n\tvalue={value}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet’s break down a few gaps of knowledge here. When an input is of type you have access to several different properties, two of which are min and max which set the two different ends of the slider.\r\n\r\nEssentially we’re just calculating the percentage size of the background color based on the value and possible max value.\r\n\r\n![input](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1638468777238/FNToB6YNm.png)\r\n\r\nStyled Background\r\n\r\n### Active Styling\r\n\r\nWith the bar styled let’s focus on some UX enhancement, with some pseudo-classes we can make the thumb look a bit prettier to the user:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput\\[type=\"range\"\\]::-webkit-slider-thumb:hover {\r\n    box-shadow: #d46a6a50 0px 0px 0px 8px;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninput\\[type=\"range\"\\]::-webkit-slider-thumb:active {\r\n    box-shadow: #d46a6a50 0px 0px 0px 11px;\r\n    transition: box-shadow 350ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms, left 350ms cubic-\r\n    bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms, bottom 350ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs well as adding some transition styling to the thumb itself:\r\n\r\n```css\r\ninput[type='range']::-webkit-slider-thumb {\r\n\t// ...other styles;\r\n\ttransition: background 0.3s ease-in-out;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that’s it!
