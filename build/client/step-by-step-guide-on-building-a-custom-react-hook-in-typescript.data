However, one feature that isn’t taken advantage of nearly as much as it should be, is the ability to create custom hooks!\r\n\r\nCustom hooks let us abstract away the logic of react components and re-use them! I suggest only doing this with logic that actually gets reused a ton throughout your web application.\r\n\r\nMore info about hooks can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this article, the example I’m going to be creating is a **useToggle** hook! Toggling something in the UI is quite common so we should get a lot of mileage out of this one.\r\n\r\n### Building the hook\r\n\r\nFirst, let’s create the file **useToggle.ts** , and let’s build the skeleton for our hook. All hooks must begin with the word **_use_**!\r\n\r\n![useToggle](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646568257917/QTX_6cPES.png)\r\n\r\nA toggle hook will typically just rely on toggling a boolean state from **true** to **false** and vice versa, however, to make it more complete let’s add some additional, _optional_, functionality to the hook where we can completely set it to **false** or **true**.\r\n\r\nLet’s create the state and the skeleton of the functions:\r\n\r\n![useToggle](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646568259117/h1SlqvFFm.png)\r\n\r\nYou should import the appropriate hooks from React itself, in this case, **useState** and **useCallback**.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **useState** hook has access to the previous state, this is generally safer to use so we’ll just toggle it with this functionality. The other two functions, **close** and open, will set the state to either true or false directly. The state of the toggle and the three functions will get returned in an array.\r\n\r\n### Typescript\r\n\r\nLast but not least, let’s give our hook some type-safety by letting the function know what we are expecting to return.\r\n\r\n![useToggle](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646568260374/4-CYpdNk4.png)\r\n\r\nWe return an array with the internal state of the hook, and the 3 functions to alter the state!\r\n\r\nAs a little extra we can add an initial state to the hook in case we want it to start off as closed or opened:\r\n\r\n![useToggle](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646568261590/X-IJwTbJh.png)\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nAnd that’s it! Hooks are a great way to abstract logic used in react components.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of the hook in action:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/embed/use-toggle-wbzlso?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\r\n","recommendations",[29,37,44,50],{"_7":30,"_9":31,"_11":12,"_13":32,"_15":33,"_19":35,"_21":22,"_23":36},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
