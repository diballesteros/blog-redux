Normally, when doing this I figure the best initial step is to figure out how the layout will go.\r\n\r\n### The Page Layout\r\n\r\nThis is the finished product but initially, I split up the page into two portions: header and tracker. This page layout seemed optimal for desktop and mobile implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, I have no plans on hooking this up to a database so I figured using local storage to keep track of a user’s data would be optimal. The header should contain an option to export and import the data of a user in case they want to save or switch computers as well as having the game options.\r\n\r\nAlso, as it is quite popular I also wanted to include a dark mode button to switch the color scheme of the app.\r\n\r\n### The Tracker\r\n\r\nTime for the meat of the application, the actual list of the encounters. As this was going to be a fairly large list with a lot of DOM elements I decided on using [react-window](rhttps://react-window.vercel.app/#/examples/list/fixed-size) for virtualization.\r\n\r\nWhile doing my own runs I constantly looked up the level caps for the gym leaders. The level cap rule for a nuzlocke challenge is where you cannot over level the highest level pokémon of the next gym leader, so as to increase the difficulty. So I definitely wanted to include level caps so as to also show progression while completing the nuzlocke.\r\n\r\nAn encounter list is basically a large CRUD operation so I decided to include buttons for deleting, adding, and editing the encounters. As well as a search bar encounter lists can get pretty long and tedious to look through.\r\n\r\n### The component library\r\n\r\nNow that I had the initial idea for how to build the app I went through various component libraries to streamline the process. I needed a dropdown that not only could I search through but that I could also display the image of the Pokémon.\r\n\r\nFrom what I saw Material-UI, ANT, ChakraUI, amongst many others, did not offer me this possibility. I thought I would have to build my own component but then I came across Semantic-UI with this neat dropdown component:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/embed/pokemon-dropdown-dn2sz?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\r\n\r\nThat is an example of how it would look with the pokémon images.\r\n\r\nWith that, I began to develop the whole initial application.\r\nNext time I’ll go over how I first promoted my app!\r\n\r\nGithub repo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diballesteros/nuzlocke\r\n\r\nCredits to: https://pokemondb.net/sprites\r\n","recommendations",[29,36,43,49],{"_7":30,"_9":31,"_11":12,"_13":32,"_15":33,"_19":34,"_21":22,"_23":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
