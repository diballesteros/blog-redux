It allows us to specify to Sentry a personalized error flow entry. It receives an object with several properties.\r\n\r\nI won’t go into detail about every single property of the object, but there are three that are very good to keep in mind!\r\n\r\n### The properties\r\n\r\n![addBreadcrumb function](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643569614663/kyD4_lJn0.png)\r\n_addBreadcrumb function_\r\n\r\nThe first property is category, in which we can detail how we want the breadcrumb to be categorized. This is just a simple string.\r\n\r\nThe second is incredibly important and is the message! This is where you could personalize and include parameters, data, etc in your error flow message.\r\n\r\nLast but not least is the level which is the severity level of the error flow message.\r\n\r\nTake into consideration these are predetermined and should be imported from the sentry library as well.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nLooking over the results of the error message we can see something along these lines:\r\n\r\n![error message](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1643569616081/zmfQDRYFz.png)\r\n\r\nThis is taken from a personal app of mine but it now shows up in the flow!\r\n","recommendations",[29,37,45,51],{"_7":30,"_9":31,"_11":12,"_13":32,"_15":33,"_19":35,"_21":22,"_23":36},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
