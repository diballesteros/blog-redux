Something that I took note of along the way is that I really liked by imports at the beginning of the file being ordered in a specific way:\r\n\r\n1. Dependencies / Built-in modules (eg ‘react’, ‘react-router-dom’)\r\n2. Internal routes of absolute folders (eg ‘components’, ‘assets’)\r\n3. Relative routes (eg ./, ../)\r\n\r\nAnd within those same subcategories, I also wanted it to be alphabetical.\r\n\r\n### ESLINT\r\n\r\nWith ESLint there are two options to flag errors or warnings when the imports are set in an incorrect order: sort-imports and with the help of a plugin eslint-plugin-import another rule with the name import/order.\r\n\r\n### sort-imports\r\n\r\n[sort-imports](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/sort-imports) offers a way to alphabetically organize the imports using the declarations or the members of the declaration. For example:\r\n\r\nWill become:\r\n\r\nGreat! We can also add a few options to ignore letter cases. In order to hook up this to ESLint we have to add a rule in the ESLint config file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"rules\": { // ..other rules, \"sort-imports\": [\"error\", { \"ignoreCase\": true, \"ignoreDeclarationSort\": true }], }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed I am ignored declaration sort here. This is intentional, we are going to have a more nuanced approach to sorting the declarations using [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import).\r\n\r\n### import/orders\r\n\r\nFor this to work the ESLint plugin must first be installed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn add eslint-plugin-import --dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nGreat! It offers a rule configuration to get very [granular](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/blob/main/docs/rules/order.md) about how we want our imports to look. We can first differentiate the groups of our imports and split them up by groups:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"rules: {\r\n    \"import/order\":\r\n    [1,{\r\n        \"groups\": [\r\n        \"external\",\r\n        \"builtin\",\r\n        \"internal\",\r\n        \"sibling\",\r\n        \"parent\",\r\n        \"index\"],\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will split the imports by the groups we specified at the beginning! Great! However, when using aliases with Typescript a few of our imports can be confused with dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis particular rule can help us circumvent these particular edge cases by specifying something called **pathGroups**.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"groups\": [\r\n\t\t[\"external\", \"builtin\"],\r\n\t\t\"internal\",\r\n\t\t[\"sibling\", \"parent\"],\r\n\t\t\"index\"\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"pathGroups\": [\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"components\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"components/**\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"constants/**\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"common\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"error/**\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"hooks/**\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"locale/**\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"routes/**\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"selectors\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"store\", \"group\": \"internal\" },\r\n\t\t{ \"pattern\": \"assets/**\", \"group\": \"internal\", \"position\": \"after\" }\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes\": [\"internal\"],\r\n\t\"alphabetize\": {\r\n\t\t\"order\": \"asc\",\r\n\t\t\"caseInsensitive\": true\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGreat now it will consider those aliased folders under the group **internal**!\r\n\r\nAs part of the linting process you could now run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn lint --fix\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it’ll fix all import sorting warnings.\r\n","recommendations",[28,36,44,50],{"_7":29,"_9":30,"_11":12,"_13":31,"_15":32,"_18":34,"_20":21,"_22":35},"what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-i-deal-with-it","What is imposter syndrome?
